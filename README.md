# KalmanFilterSpringMassDamper
Simulated a spring-mass-damper system and applied a Kalman Filter for real-time state estimation using noisy measurements. Implemented in MATLAB.
Project: State Estimation of a Spring-Mass-Damper System using a Kalman Filter

In this project, I simulated a spring-mass-damper system in MATLAB, added process and measurement noise, and used a discrete-time Kalman Filter to estimate the system's true states (position and velocity) from noisy measurements.

Key Highlights:

- Modeled a second-order dynamic system and discretized it using matrix exponentials

- Simulated realistic process and sensor noise using covariance-based stochastic models

- Implemented a discrete Kalman Filter for real-time state estimation

Visualized state trajectories, estimation error, and 3Ïƒ confidence bounds

- Demonstrated significant accuracy improvements over raw noisy measurements
